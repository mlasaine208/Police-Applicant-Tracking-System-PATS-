Roadmap for the Police Applicant Tracking System (PATS) Solution Starter

This is the first iteration of the VPolice Applicant Tracking System (PATS) Solution Starter. It is my goal to have Microsoft Technology Sales Professionals/Solution Architects, Partners, etc. contribute to the solution and or use the solution and build off of it for their own IP. 

Public sector or Private Organizations are welcome to contribute to the solution, submit additional feature requests to milasain@microsoft.com or download for their own use and or modification.
