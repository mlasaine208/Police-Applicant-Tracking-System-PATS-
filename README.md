# Acknowledgement - Please Read Before Proceeding
This document is intended to act as a guide for installing and configuring the Police Applicant Tracking System (PATS) solution. As requested, the Snohomish County Microsoft Dynamics sales team is providing Snohomish County a guide (aka “manual” or “guide”), which was based on the Los Angeles Police Department’s initial Virtual Mentor solution requirements and resulting initial product demonstration.

This solution is intended to act in trial or demonstrating purposes only. The Police Applicant Tracking System (PATS) solution is intended to act as a tool to improve recruitment and candidate management processes, specifically for law enforcement, police and sheriff organizations. Although this solution can greatly assist you in making large and effective strides in building out a baseline solution, it is important to note that guide was not based on a formal Proof of Concept (POC) or an actual production deployment.
Therefore, by using this guide in any manner, any individual or organization who imports the PATS solution agrees to the following:

1.  The PATS solution is an “unmanaged solution” and intended for trial or demonstration purposes only.

2.  There is no expectation for Microsoft to support the PATS solution once it is imported, including repairs or fixes, updates or modifications. As well, individuals or organizations leveraging this open-source solution waives Microsoft of any service or product-related expectations (solution, configuration, customization, deployment, implementation or post-production support as it is, in perpetuity), accountability or responsibility. We are not providing services – only documentation and baseline configurations to assist you in your self-deployment.

3.	The guide is meant to gain a stronger understanding of Dynamics 365 per as a recruitment management use case, and is not meant to act as a best-practice model or any specific recruitment process. This solution should not be promoted “As Is” into a production instance, and it is highly advisable for any user or organization review their own unique recruitment processes, policies and procedures and further configure how Dynamics 365 will work best for them from a recruiting capacity accordingly.

4.	This solution is not intended to replace professional Dynamics 365 solution deployment and implementation, which may be required to achieve the level of success the individual or organization leveraging this open-source solution ultimately expects. This includes, but is not limited to, portals configuration, security, business rules, extended customization, reports and dashboard development, workflows and external solution integration. While the open-source solution is a great way to demonstrate alignment with your business process, we recommend a qualified partner work with you to develop a holistic Dynamics 365 solution to meet your business objectives.

5.	With this said, by importing and using the PATS open-source solution in any manner, and any related documents, the individual or organization agrees to use the solution only as described above, and will not be shared or sold in any manner for any purposes other than for  demonstration or trial usage without Microsoft’s written permission, outlining the same considerations above.
